    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dengue Fever** is also known as breakbone fever and dandy fever It is a single-stranded RNA virus caused by Mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. These mosquitoes are most often found in **urban** areas as they like to harvest in man made products such as tires, flowerpots, and buckets. They were brought into Northern America and Europe by Asian products. It should be noted that they are capable of surviving subfreezing temperatures, allowing them to spread to cooler climates. There are four types of Dengue viruses which results in an acute infectious disease with **symptoms** of a high fever, joint pain, and muscle pain. The first signs of dengue includes fever, headache, joint pain, and rashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This disease is spread through the **female mosquito** bite and often occurs in tropical areas. A mosquito becomes infected when it drinks the blood of a person who is already infected with dengue. The mosquito can transmit the virus after one week of being infected. Dengue can’t be spread from person-to-person; however, infected humans can travel and potentially spread dengue to other countries. Other than providing a patient with pain medications and fluid, there is no specific **treatment** for dengue. A dengue vaccine is being developed and one has been approved for use in Mexico and Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Predict weekly reported dengue fever cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos Perú based on environmental variables.\n",
    "The format for the post-analysis submission file is simply the `city, year, weekofyear, total_cases`\n",

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that lacking values were filled with `NaN`. Initially we considered dropping all rows that contain any nulls. After some consideration we realized that we would be losing a lot of data if we did so. Our strategy will be to make a temporary data frame for each model we use. Each of these will drop rows with nulls **only** if the variable being used for that row is a null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Added a new variable `new_avg_temp_c` to the data frame that averages both `station_avg_temp_c` and `reanalysis_avg_temp_k`."
